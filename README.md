# üìí Wiki

This project repository has [a great wiki](https://github.com/Mohit410/lms1/wiki) that you should consider reading! It goes into detail about the project from a more technical aspect. If you are interested in learning more about the app itself, go ahead and check it out!

# üë®‚Äçüíª Tech stack

Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack the LMS app uses:

- This project uses the [Flutter app development framework](https://flutter.dev/). Flutter is a cross-platform hybrid app development platform which allows us to use a single codebase for apps on mobile, desktop, and the web.
- 
- The app uses the font ["Lato"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/lato) as its main font, and the design of the app adheres to the material-3 design guidelines.

For more information on the technologies that power the LMS app, check out the [Tech Stack](https://github.com/Mohit410/lms1/wiki/Tech-Stack) page on our wiki.
